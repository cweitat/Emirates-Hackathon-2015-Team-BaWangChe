# Laravel-Bootstrap-Web-Interface
Emirates Hackathon 2015 Entry by team Ba Wang Che

This project is built with Laravel (https://laravel.com/), Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/), PHP and mySQL. 
The idea for this project is to enable travellers to book their mode of transport, customized to their needs, before the travel date.

Project stopped since end of hackathon. Working parts are the UI and simple function such as login and storing information in database.
